# Help about `taxharmonizexplorer`

This tab is to help you use the <a onclick="customHref(&#39;network&#39;)">"Network" tab</a> available above.
Here we are going to detail the interface available to the user.

<img style="float: right;padding: 5px" src="app_help.png", width="65%">

The interface of the Network panel is divided in four parts:

* (**a**) is the **navigation bar** (navbar) that let's you navigate across the different tabs.
* (**b**) is the **node information text box**, it displays summary information about the node selected in the network to help you identify it.
* (**c**) is the **node table**, it display the complete list of nodes in the network. You can click on one (or multiple) row(s) to select the corresponding node(s) in the network. You can also search text (like a possible node name or your taxonomic group of interest) in the search bar at the top right, this will only display the list of nodes that match the searched text.
* (**d**) is the **network display**, which is the central panel describing the network of tools. By default it displays the full network but to be more usable you can zoom with the mouse wheel, the keyboard, or the commands at the bottom. When you click on a node it highlights it and keep only the nodes directly connected to it in color.
