# Help about `taxharmonizexplorer`

This tab is to help you use the <a onclick="customHref(&#39;network&#39;)">"Network" tab</a> available above.
Here we are going to detail the interface available to the user.

<img style="float: right;padding: 5px" src="app_help.png", width="65%">

The interface of the Network panel is divided in four parts:

* (**a**) is the navigation bar (navbar) that let's you navigate across the different tabs.
* (**b**) is the node information text box, it displays summary information about the node selected in the network to help you identify it.
* (**c**) is the node table, it display the complete list of node available in the network and you click on rows to select the corresponding node on the network, you can also search text like the node name of the taxonomic group in the search bar in the top right.
* (**d**) is the network display, which is the central panel describing the network of tools. By default it displays the full network but to be more usable you can zoom with the mouse wheel, the keyboard, or the commands at the bottom. When you click on a node it highlights it and keep only the nodes directly connected to it in color.
