# Potential abstract

Ecology is becoming increasingly data intensive, with data coming in many forms: range maps, occurrences, traits, phylogenies. These come from a diversity of sources that need to be matched to provide ecological insights.
Species names provide a key to match data unambiguously from distinct databases.
Different taxonomies can however be used by the databases, with similar species named differently due to possible synonymy. Prior to make these data corresponds, the user has thus to harmonize the taxonomy between data sources to resolve potential species names conflict. This process can become cumbersome when working on hundreds or more species, or when working with species from many different taxonomic groups.
There are no review of the programmatic tools and approaches used for taxonomic harmonization.
We here review some taxonomic reference providers that can be used, as well as the available R tools that help access and wrangle taxonomic data. We then suggest possible workflows through worked out case studies for both mono-trophic and multi-trophic contexts. We then formulate best practices and recommendations for data providers, tools developers, and users.
